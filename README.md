# TerrainGenerationWebGPU

This project was the final project of RITâ€™s Introduction to Computer Graphics, which I took in the fall semester of 2024. The class took us through the history of graphics, moving from 2D to 3D, teaching us first about rending lines, then shapes, then full 3D scenes. Previously, this course was taught in OpenGL, but our professor switched the curriculum to work in WebGPU, as it is a little more modern, and works well in a classroom where students are working on machines with different operating systems.
For our final project, we needed to render a 3D scene using some sort of terrain generation algorithm, complete with a 3D camera. I selected the Diamond Square algorithm, as we discussed it in class, and I felt it would be a good starting point for me implement, as before this project, I had limited experience with terrain generation.
